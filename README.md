# Agentic AI Bootcamp (LangGraph + LangChain)

This repo contains my code, notes, experiments, and projects from the Udemy course:  
[Complete Agentic AI Bootcamp With LangGraph and LangChain](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-agentic-ai-bootcamp-with-langgraph-and-langchain/)

## About
I’m using this space to track my progress while learning how to build **agentic AI systems** with **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.  
The course covers:
- Core concepts of agentic AI (agents with tools, memory, and reasoning).
- Building workflows with LangGraph.
- Multi-agent collaboration and communication.
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents.
- Real-world project implementations.

## Repo Structure
